        <p class="text-md md:text-lg mb-6 leading-tight font-serif">My name is Sam Goddard, I'm a 30 year old Web Developer based in Nottingham city centre. I'm currently employed as a full time developer at <a class="link" href="https://madebykind.com">Kind</a>, where I help build and maintain scaleable front-end systems for socially responsible organisations.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">I started my career path at the University of Lincoln, where I graduated in September 2009 with a 2:1 in BA Hons Multimedia Technology. From an early age I was fascinated with computers, video games and technology, this course helped nurture that interest into a passion for web design and development. I spent time outside my lectures building MySpace and Geocities profiles for my mates, with my final dissertation documenting a WordPress build for my mates artist management agency.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">I was lucky enough to pick up a job straight out of university at a <span class="italic">then</span> small digital agency <a class="link" href="https://adtrak.co.uk">Adtrak</a>. The role was primarily 'marketing' to a degree, but incorporated some template updates in Adobe Dreamweaver which had me keen to learn more. I was promoted to a 'web designer' role after a year, which threw me in at the deep end of both design and front-end development.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">After 6 years at Adtrak and multiple job role changes, I finally decided it was time to move on and further my career elsewhere. Adtrak will always have a special place in my heart, I met some lifelong friends there and have people like <a href="http://www.zellement.com/" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Farrow</a> and <a href="https://www.andymorley.co.uk/" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Morley</a> to thank for where I am in my career now. Adtrak are now over 120 employees strong and venturing into the global market, they offer some great paths into the industry and have one of the most awesome bunch of employees I've had the pleasure of working with.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-light mb-6 leading-tight">Making waves with <span class="font-serif-bold">Impression</span></h2>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">In March 2015 I secured a job at a local rival agency startup <a href="https://www.impression.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="link">Impression</a> like a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Commons" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Judas</a>. Impression were making waves in the industry at the time with the solid work they where putting out and I was stoked to start leading their front-end with the interesting clientbase they had already begun to build up. I worked closely alongside a small team of marketers, designers, and their developers <a href="https://www.impression.co.uk/about/our-team/james-hastings-hall/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">James H-Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.impression.co.uk/about/our-team/aaron-dicks/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aaron Dicks</a>, who were instrumentl in helping me learn the Wordpress ropes.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">This role helped me nurture my interest for modular, scaleable front-end systems, with it's smaller team, it allowed way more control over the front-end handover process which had me constantly looking for methods in which to improve it. I also got to work with some well known names, including <a href="https://plumen.com/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plumen</a>, who I helped launch their new ecommerce website in late 2015, my first venture into Shopify.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">Impression are now continuing to blow up, moving to a larger office with an even larger beer fridge and more hunger to grow. Unfortunately, I began to tire of Wordpress quite quickly, and although I decided to look elswhere for my next challenge, still get a regular invite to Rock City or bowling with the Impression gang.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">In 2017 I joined <a href="http://mathayward.com/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mat</a>, <a href="https://www.tomdavies.net/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tom</a> and <a href="http://www.georgia-cavanagh.com/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Georgia</a> at <a href="https://madebykind.com/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kind</a>, a small strategic digital agency based in Nottingham's Lace Market. Kind offer Strategic thinking &amp; digital delivery for socially responsible brands, primarily the arts and education sector. Kind have worked with a plethora of well known, reputable organisations including <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sheffield Hallam University</a>, <a href="https://www.ntu.ac.uk/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nottingham Trent University</a>, <a href="https://www.henley.ac.uk/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Henley Business School</a>, <a href="http://owsla.com/" class="link" rel="noopner" target="_blank">OWSLA</a> and <a href="https://theodi.org/" class="link" rel="noopner" target="_blank">The Open Data Institute</a>.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">My role encompasses all aspects of modern front-end development, with the small team making access to bleeding-edge technologies, and modern methodologies possible. Kind are a <a href="https://craftcms.com/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Craft CMS</a> partner, meaning the majority of my work is done with their incredible Content Management System. Coming from a Wordpress background, Craft and it's Twig based templating framework really re-ignited my love for development.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">Outside of their development role, Kind try to do as much as they can to be eco-friendly and contribute towards sustainability focused causes, last year we took a bunch of steps in an attempt to <a href="https://madebykind.com/blog/how-were-trying-to-be-more-green" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">become more green</a>, <a href="https://madebykind.com/blog/2018-a-year-in-review" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create positive impacts</a>, and <a href="https://madebykind.com/blog/kind-go-wild-in-wales" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">helped Surfers Against Sewage clean up Newborough beach</a>.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">I use a bunch of Open Source tools at Kind and am encouraged to contribute to OS as much as possible. My role allows time for this monthly and I've been working on the core maintainer team at <a href="https://fractal.build/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fractal</a> for the past year or so. We use Fractal on almost every project, so it feels really good to give time back to the team that built this awesome tool. I published my first large OS update to the Fractal org a few months back with the <a href="https://github.com/frctl/fractal-docs" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">migration of the current documentation site to VuePress</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-light mb-6 leading-tight">Outside of <span class="font-serif-bold">work</span></h2>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-6">Outside of work I like to keep up with anything dev related that's not necessarily part of my day-to-day job, like building this site in <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nuxt</a>. I am in the process of volunteering for a local <a href="https://codeclub.org" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Code Club</a>, a programme run by the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Raspberyy Pi Foundation</a> and registered UK charity that provides children with the opportunity to learn to code through after school clubs. I'm a Nottingham Forest season ticket holder and have been on and off since I was a kid. I'm really into music, I have a whole host of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sam_goddard" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">questionable playlists on my public Spotify.</a></p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">I've loved video video games since I got a SEGA Megadrive for Christmas as a kid and would love to one day work in the gaming industry. I peaked at top 5% EUW in Season 5 of League, not bad for a washed up 30 year old. Final Fantasy VII, Ocarina of Time and Red Alert 2 are my favourite games of all time. I'm currently playing Apex Legends and Celeste <span class="italic">again</span></p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-normal font-sans mb-10">I absolutely love animals and can usually be found hanging out with my girlfriends labradors Win and Nel at the weekends. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet or a zookeeper, I guess web developer will do. As a kid I had a budgie called Sky who was <span class="italic">the fucking best</span>. I also had a guinea pig called Mr Hahn. The film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125454/" class="link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paulie</a> makes me cry and scarred me for life. I would like to volunteer at a local animal shelter when I have some more free time on my hands.</p>
